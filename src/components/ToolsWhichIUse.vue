    <div class="mt-3 text-justify">

    <div class="text-xl mt-6">Vue.js</div>
    <div class="mt-3 text-justify">
      Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a JavaScript framework for building
      user interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
      and provides a declarative and component-based programming model that
      helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be it simple or complex.

    <div class="text-xl mt-6">Pinia</div>
    <div class="mt-3 text-justify">
      Pinia started as an experiment to redesign what a Store for Vue could look
      like with the Composition API around November 2019. Since then, the
      initial principles are still the same, but Pinia works for both Vue 2 and
      Vue 3 and doesn't require you to use the composition API. The API is the
      same for both except for installation and SSR, and these docs are targeted
      to Vue 3 with notes about Vue 2 whenever necessary so it can be read by
      Vue 2 and Vue 3 users!

    <div class="mt-3 text-justify">
      Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. It is
      isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same
      codebase). On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module,
      while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.

      corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.
